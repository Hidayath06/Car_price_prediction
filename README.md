Car Price Prediction Analysis

This project implements a data-driven approach to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of car features—such as make, model, year, mileage, engine type, and condition—this analysis explores data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development to estimate market prices accurately. The project employs popular algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) and includes performance evaluation metrics like RMSE and R² to ensure model reliability. Designed for scalability and real-world application, this repository provides detailed documentation, code, and insights for enthusiasts, data scientists, and automotive industry professionals aiming to understand or predict car pricing trends.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature selection and engineering for optimal predictions
Implementation of multiple machine learning models
Model evaluation and comparison
Visualizations for price trends and feature importance

Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
